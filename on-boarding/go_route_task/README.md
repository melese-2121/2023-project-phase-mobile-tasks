# Task Management App

A Flutter application for managing tasks with smooth navigation and state management using `go_router`. This app allows users to add, view, and edit tasks, featuring named routes, data passing between screens, and custom navigation animations.

## Functionality

- **Home Screen**: Displays a list of all tasks.
- **Add Task Screen**: Provides a form to input the title and description of a new task.
- **Edit Task Screen**: Allows users to view and modify the details of an existing task.

### Navigation with `go_router`

- **Named Routes**:

  - `home`: Route for the home screen where all tasks are listed.
  - `addTask`: Route for the screen to add a new task.
  - `viewEditTask`: Route for the screen to edit an existing task.

- **Passing Data**:

  - Task data is passed between the home screen and the view and edit screen using `go_router` mechanisms.

- **Navigation Animations**:

  - Smooth transitions and animations between screens are implemented using `go_router`'s animation features.

- **Handling Navigation Events**:
  - The back navigation from the add/edit screens returns to the home screen seamlessly.
